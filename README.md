# visualTesting
This is a project I started to explore some concepts about Visual Testing.

It uses 
- Shutterbug to capture the screenshots.
- Selenium for everything related to UI interaction.

In the future I would integrate a library to validate the difference between two different images as a merge of them.

#DriverLocation
place chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) in folder:
- src/test/resources/driver

# To execute
