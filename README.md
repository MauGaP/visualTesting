# visualTesting

This is a project I started to explore some concepts about Visual Testing

It uses 
Shutterbug to capture the screenshots
Selenium for everything related to element navigations

And in the future I would integrate a library to create images wiith the result of two different images.

# To execute it

- mvn clean verify
